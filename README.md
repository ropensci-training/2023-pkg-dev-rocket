# Package Development: Not Rocket Science

## Workshop for rOpenSci champions

This repo contains the materials for a 2-hour workshop on R package development. 

It is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the following themes:

* [Hugo theme learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn)
* [Hugo theme reveal-hugo](https://github.com/dzello/reveal-hugo)

Slides for each section are listed in the menu and opened in a new tab (thanks to a [custom menu layout](/blob/master/layouts/partials/menu.html), compared to the original Hugo learn theme).

Some Markdown content is generated with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), using [hugodown](https://github.com/r-lib/hugodown/).

The website is deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
